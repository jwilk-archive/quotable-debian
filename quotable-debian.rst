Foundation of Debian:

   This is just to announce the imminent completion of a brand-new Linux
   release, which I'm calling the Debian Linux Release.

The first multi-arch proposal:

   I would love to see Debian adopt a solution that allows use of unmodified
   ia32 (i386 in Debian lingo) packages on ia64 systems... and which is general
   enough to handle the other multi-arch flavors we can anticipate.

   [...]

   Of course, doing this is a lot of work. Clearly, other distributions
   supporting ia64 have chosen to take more expedient paths. If there's a good
   hack I haven't thought of that won't make us all ill, I'd be pleased to
   consider it. I'm not thrilled by the path translation on the fly, but it is
   clearly an alternative we could consider, for example.

   I intend for ia64 to be released stable with woody. I would love for the
   ia32 user space "problem" to be resolved cleanly by then, but I'm not
   expecting miracles. If I have to hack something interim while waiting for a
   general solution to be implemented, I can probably live with that.

   THIS IS NOT A FUCKING VOTE.

Extreme anger about init system call-for-votes:

   This unannounced CFV is an abuse of process.  I am EXTREMELY ANGRY
   and I will sponsor any GR that seeks to overturn it.
